# Supplemental Materials for Code Comprehension: Where Did We Go Wrong?

This repository contains the supplemental materials for our ASE '25 submission.
See [repos.txt](./repos.txt) for a list of repositories examined.

## Data
[data/](./data/) contains the full metrics and statistics calculations for methods examined, including the complexity and readability metrics, Cliff's Delta, and p-values. The actual parsed comments are too large to include.

## Analysis
[sample.ipynb](./sample.ipynb) contains example python code for loading and using the data in the [data/](./data) folder. See the computed values already there for by-repository stats such as CommentMethod percentage by repository, or comment type breakdown by language.

## Figures
[fis/](./figs) contains the full-sized figures from the paper to allow closer introspection (and zooming!)
